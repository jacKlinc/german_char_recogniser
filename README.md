# German Character Recognition
Classify German alphabet using deep learning. Currently only works with characters A and B. Model was trained in a colab notebook and exported to the Streamlit app below.

Next step is train for all vowels then add in the [umlaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_umlaut).
